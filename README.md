# Customer Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI project provides an analysis of customer sales data, focusing on the segmentation of customers based on their total sales contributions. It includes a **pie chart** visualization to categorize customers into high-value, mid-value, and low-value segments.

     - **Low-Value**: Total Sales ≤ $2,000
   - Helps identify where most of the sales revenue is concentrated.
